after drawing a circle in draw mode, you can exit to edit mode (press `e`), select the circle, then type `II`, that will spawn an info text attached to that circle:

1. the top number is the order of that circle;
2. the string in the middle is its op string;
3. the number at the bottom is its num value

typing `ID` will toggle showing the entity id at the top:
